# Facial-Emotion-Detection-
This project is a Real-Time Facial Emotion Detection System that trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on grayscale facial images to recognize seven emotions â€” Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise. Using TensorFlow/Keras for model training and OpenCV for live video capture, the system detects faces from a webcam feed, classifies the emotion, and displays it in real-time on the video stream.
